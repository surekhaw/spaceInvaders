# Space Invaders

At The Last Mile, our Web Development Fundamentals ("WDF") students learn javascript and jQuery skills.  One of the required assignments by which they demonstrate their mastery of these skills is by creating a Space Invaders game.  A demonstration video is available for students to view so they can get an idea of how the end result should look and function.  

This project is an exemplar created for The Last Mile WDF students to review after they submit their assignment that mimics the demonstration video so they can see a possible solution for the assignment and compare their code for ideas and improvements.  

This project was created for The Last Mile while employed as a Web Development Education Apprentice and is herein included with permission of The Last Mile.
